wikipedia-tracer
================

Enter a Wikipedia article (or choose one at random), and wikipedia-tracer will automate your descent into the rabbit hole.

It tracks and displays the trail formed by following the first link mentioned in the article (that isn't in bold, italitcs, or disambiguation headings) and notify you when the trail reaches a loop.
